Stack in C | Queue in C


C programming language offers various types of features and functionalities to the programmers. We learnt how to implement arrays and linked lists in C. So, In this tutorial, we are going to teach you a new and important concept of data structures which is Stack and Queues. Stack and Queue in C are very useful and efficient concept to learn.

What is Stack in C?
Stack is known as a linear data structure. It follows the Last-In-First-Out rule. So, if you push something to the stack then the last value which you pushed, will be the first to pop out. The insertion and deletion operation on the stack will only take place from one end which is the top of the stack.

In 2 ways, you can implement a stack in C.

1. Statically:- In C, you can implement a stack using an array. It allows static memory allocation of its data elements. In this, the stack inherits all the features of the array.

2. Dynamically:- You can also implement a stack using a linked list. It allows dynamic memory allocation of its data elements. In this, the stack takes over the characteristics of the linked list.

Applications of Stack in C:-
1. Number Reversing:- You can easily reverse a sequence of characters or digits.

2. Undo Operation:- In text editors, you can see an undo operation. If you click it then all the changes you made will go back to normal. All the changes are stored into the stack.

3. Infix to Postfix Conversion: With the help of stacks, you can convert from infix to postfix.

4. Backtracking:- You can use stacks to solve various maze puzzling problems.

5. Depth First Search:â€“ With the help of stacks, you can perform a searching algorithm named Depth-First Search.


What is a Queue in C?



Queue is known as a linear data structure. It follows the First-In-First-Out rule. So, if you push something to the stack then the first value of the stack will pop out. In the queue, the insertion operation is done from the rear end(back) and the deletion is done from the front.

In 2 ways, you can implement the queue in C.

1. Statically:- In C, you can implement a queue using an array. It allows static memory allocation of its data elements. In this, the queue inherits all the features of the array.

2. Dynamically:- You can also implement a queue using a linked list. It allows dynamic memory allocation of its data elements. In this, the queue takes over the characteristics of the linked list.

NOTE:- You can implement both stacks and queues statically or dynamically. It depends on you.

Applications of Queue in C:-
There are various applications of queue. Some of the applications of queue:-

1. Round robin algorithm:- Using the queue, you can perform the round robin algorithm.

2. CPU Scheduling:- With the help of a queue, you can share resources among multiple users at the same time. In a queue, data is processed according to the First-In-First-Out rule.

3. Input-Output Buffers:- Using a queue, you can convert the asynchronous data to synchronous data.
